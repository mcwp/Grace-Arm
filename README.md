Grace-Arm
=========

This is a low cost prosthesis design for people with arms which end between the elbow and wrist. 


It uses ~1.5mm cabling (I'm using kevlar thread so far) and thin elastic thread to draw the fingers back. The fingers are actuated by the motion of the elbow.

Required Hardware:
-Cabling
-Thin elastic thread
-About 10 M4 8mm length Chicago screws from ChicagoScrews.com
-3d printed parts found here
-one M8 threaded rod to act as the prosthetic forearm. Length varies with user.
-one M5 threaded rod to aid M8 rod in forearm. Length equal to M8
-Four M8 nuts
-Four M5 nuts
-3 M4 Nylock Nuts
-one M4 rod cut to width of knuckles + two nylock nuts = 81 mm
-One M4x16 or M4x20 screw



Assembly:
-Print all pieces
-Sand all interfacing surfaces in the joints until they move smoothly
-Thread cabling through the holes in the bottom of the fingers before assembling *pictures coming soon*
-Assemble using chicago screws in the mid-finger joints and M4 rod/screws in the hand/finger joints.
-The chicago screws only need to be finger tight
-Thread one piece of elastic thread through the upper holes in each finger, then put both ends of the thread through the holes at the hand/finger knuckles. Finally, thread one end of the thread through one of the holes in the bar near the wrist, and tie the ends together to form a loop. Experiment with the tension in the elastic until the fingers pull back consistently.
-Tighten an M4 nylock onto each end of the M4 rod in the knuckles until the nylock is engaged. Don't actually tighten them down onto the plastic, or it will flex slightly and make the knuckles move less freely.
-Insert nuts into the nut traps of the wrist piece
-Screw nuts down onto the ends of the arm rods
-Screw arm rods in until tight
???????
-Figure out how to mount the other ends of the arm rods to the user's arm
-Find a way to attach the cables to the tricep region of the user's arm, ideally using a tensioning block found on the e-nable group.
